## Writing Tests

- Use Jest for writing tests.
- Place test files in the `__tests__` directory.
- Follow the naming convention `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`.
- Ensure tests cover both functionality and edge cases.
- Aim for high test coverage (95% or above).

## Running Tests

To run tests locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This will also generate a coverage report in the `coverage` directory.
